# yi equals C

<!-- veragrid-block-introduction:start -->
**yi equals C** belongs to the hybrid/event layer of a dynamic model. It selects, stores, delays, or switches signals according to conditions, so its result depends on discrete mode or accepted simulation history in addition to the instantaneous continuous variables.

## Typical use

- Use it for protection, enable/disable sequences, sampled control, reset logic, and mode transfer.
- Define initial mode and boundary behavior explicitly to avoid unintended event chattering.

`yi equals C` compares the input signal against a constant threshold and outputs a true-like result when they are equal.

yo = (yi = C)
