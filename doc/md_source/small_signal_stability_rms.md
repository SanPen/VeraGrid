# 🔍 Small-Signal Stability Analysis

RMS Small-Signal stability analysis linearizes the RMS dynamic model around one operating point and computes the corresponding eigenvalues and modal information.

Before running the RMS Small-Signal assessment, a power-flow solution must exist because the RMS model is initialized from that operating point.

## RMS Workflow

The RMS Small-Signal driver follows two stages.

1. Build and initialize the RMS DAE model from the grid and the power-flow results.
2. Evaluate the linearization at the requested assessment time.

If `ss_assessment_time == 0.0`, the linearization is computed directly at the initialized RMS operating point.

If `ss_assessment_time > 0.0`, the driver first runs an RMS simulation from `t = 0` up to the requested assessment instant, and then linearizes the model at that dynamic state.

## Settings

This is the Small-Signal settings page:

![](figures/dynamics/dynamic_settings.png)

### Small-Signal settings

- **Assessment time (s)**: Time instant where the linearization is evaluated.
- **Modes**: Number of eigenvalues to compute.

The `Modes` option selects the numerical path used by the driver.

- If `k = 0`, all available modes are computed with the dense algorithm.
- If `k >= n - 1`, where `n = number of states + number of differential variables`, the driver also falls back to the dense algorithm.
- If `0 < k < n - 1`, the sparse algorithm is used and returns only `k` modes.

### RMS settings used by the assessment

When `ss_assessment_time > 0.0`, the RMS simulation settings become part of the workflow because the system must first be simulated to the target instant.

- **Integration method**: RMS time-domain integrator used before linearization.
  - `DynamicIntegrationMethod.DaeBackEuler`
- **Time step (s)**: RMS integration step used to reach the assessment time.
- **Maximum iterations**: Nonlinear iterations allowed inside each implicit RMS step.
- **Initialization method**: RMS initialization strategy used to build the operating point before the simulation starts.
  - For example: `RmsInitializationMethod.PseudoTransient`
  - Or: `RmsInitializationMethod.Explicit`
- **Simulation time**: Must be consistent with the requested assessment time when the RMS simulation is used.
- **Verbose**: Controls the amount of printed diagnostic information.

The Small-Signal driver currently advances the pre-assessment RMS simulation with the RMS integration method selected in `RmsOptions` and then evaluates the Jacobians at the requested time.

## Numerical Formulation

The RMS Small-Signal implementation supports two related formulations.

### Standard formulation

When the RMS model has no differential-variable block in the generalized sense, the driver builds the classical reduced state matrix

$$
A = fx - fy \, gy^{-1} \, gx
$$

from the DAE Jacobians.

The eigenanalysis is then the standard problem

$$
A v = \lambda v
$$

In this case:

- the state matrix stored in the results is the reduced state matrix
- participation factors are computed from the left and right eigenvectors of `A`
- the participation-factor rows usually align with the RMS state variables

### Generalized formulation

When the RMS model includes differential variables that must be retained explicitly, the driver solves the generalized eigenvalue problem

$$
A v = \lambda E v
$$

using the matrices returned by `problem.get_static_state_matrix(x, dx)` and `problem.get_E_matrix(x, dx)`.

In this case:

- the state matrix stored in the results corresponds to the unreduced generalized linearization matrix used for the eigenanalysis
- participation factors are computed with the generalized normalization

$$
w_i^T E v_i = 1
$$
- the participation-factor rows and state-matrix axes can include both state and algebraic variables

This is why the results object also stores:

- `stat_vars_array`
- `algebraic_vars_array`

Those arrays identify how the result tables must be labelled in standard and generalized cases.

## Dense vs Sparse Calculation

The RMS driver exposes two eigensolution paths.

### Dense calculation

Dense calculation is used when all modes are requested.

- It computes the complete eigenvalue spectrum.
- It is the path used when `k = 0`.
- It is also used when `k` is large enough that sparse extraction is no longer meaningful.
- For the standard formulation it solves the full eigenproblem of the reduced matrix.
- For the generalized formulation it solves the dense generalized eigenproblem.

Dense calculation is the correct choice when:

- the full modal spectrum is required
- a complete participation-factor matrix is needed
- the model is small or medium enough that a full solve is affordable

### Sparse calculation

Sparse calculation is used when only a subset of modes is requested.

- It computes only `k` eigenvalues.
- It is used when `0 < k < n - 1`.
- It relies on sparse linear algebra and shift-and-invert style operators.
- It is the preferred path for large RMS models when only the dominant modes are needed.

Sparse calculation is the correct choice when:

- the model is large
- only a limited number of electromechanical or critical modes are required
- full-spectrum dense analysis would be unnecessarily expensive

## Results

The RMS Small-Signal study provides four result tables.

- **Modes**: Modal properties and the source table for the S-domain plot.
- **Participation factors**: Normalized participation-factor matrix. Row `k`, column `i` gives the participation of variable `k` in mode `i`.
- **State matrix**: Linearized state or generalized system matrix used by the modal analysis.
- **Right eigenvectors**: Right eigenvector matrix and the source table for the mode-shape plots.

### Modes and the S-domain plot

The **Modes** result replaces the former separate **S-Domain Plot** and **S-Domain Plot in Hz** entries. It contains one row per eigenvalue and the following columns.

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `Real` | Real part of the eigenvalue. |
| `Imaginary [rad/s]` | Signed imaginary part in radians per second. |
| `Imaginary [Hz]` | Signed imaginary part divided by $2\pi$. Both members of a conjugate pair are retained. |
| `Damping ratio` | Damping ratio reported by the modal calculation. |
| `Oscillation frequency` | Frequency in hertz assigned only to the representative member of an oscillatory conjugate pair. Other rows contain `NaN`. |

Clicking **Plot** with no selection draws all visible modes in the complex plane using `Real` and `Imaginary [rad/s]`. The plot includes the $\zeta=5\%$ damping boundary, and hovering over a point shows its mode name and coordinates.

To plot a subset of modes, select cells or complete rows in the **Modes** table before clicking **Plot**. A filter applied to the table also limits the visible modes. When there is no selection, every mode that remains visible after filtering is plotted.

To use hertz on the imaginary axis:

1. Hold `Ctrl` and select the complete `Real` and `Imaginary [Hz]` column headers.
2. Optionally select the desired modal rows while keeping both complete columns selected.
3. Click **Plot**.

Only a complete pair consisting of `Real` and one of the two `Imaginary` columns changes the plot coordinates. Selecting ordinary cells chooses modes; it does not redefine the coordinate pair.

![](figures/dynamics/SDomain_plot_VeraGrid.png)

### Right eigenvectors and mode-shape plots

The **Right eigenvectors** table contains state variables in its rows and modes in its columns. Oscillatory representative modes include their frequency on a second line in the column header, for example `Mode 4` followed by `f=0.443 Hz`.

Clicking **Plot** draws each selected mode in a separate real-versus-imaginary subplot. Each state component is represented by an arrow from the origin. The vectors are phase-aligned with their dominant visible component and normalized so that this component has unit magnitude; this preserves the relative magnitude and phase of the other components.

Modes can be chosen by selecting their column headers or any cells in their columns. The column-name filter can also be used to reduce the table before plotting; for example, `col like Hz` keeps the oscillatory representative modes whose headers include a frequency. Select complete row headers to restrict the plotted state components. If there is no selection, all visible modes and state rows are plotted.

Complex-plane plotting is available for the original **Modes** and **Right eigenvectors** representations. Table transformations such as transpose, absolute value, or cumulative distribution produce a generic transformed table and therefore use the standard series plot.

### Result interpretation notes

- `damping_ratios` and `conjugate_frequencies` are reported for the representative member of each oscillatory conjugate pair.
- The other member of the conjugate pair and non-oscillatory modes keep `NaN` entries in those vectors.
- `Imaginary [Hz]` is different from `Oscillation frequency`: the former is a signed coordinate available for every eigenvalue, while the latter identifies one representative per oscillatory pair.
- In generalized RMS cases, result tables can include algebraic variables in addition to state variables.

### Assessment at a nonzero time

To linearize the system at a later instant, keep the same workflow and change the assessment time.

```python
sss_options = RmsSmallSignalStabilityOptions(
    k=20,
    ss_assessment_time=5.0,
    verbose=1,
)
```

In that case, the driver first runs the RMS simulation to `t = 5.0 s` and then computes the modal analysis there.

## Benchmark

### Running ANDES

Thanks to its symbolic precision and reliable numerical performance, ANDES provides a great baseline for stability analysis in contemporary power system studies. That's why VeraGrid uses ANDES as its benchmark for Small-Signal analysis. Of course, VeraGrid successfully reproduces all eigenvalue placements from ANDES.

VeraGrid loads ANDES models by opening json files. Naturally, VeraGrid replicates all eigenvalue results from ANDES across standard benchmarks like the Kundur two area system with consistent accuracy and sub-second performance.

This is the code to get ANDES results:

```python
"""
To run this script andes must be installed (pip install andes)
"""
import andes
import time
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

def stability_andes():

   ss = andes.load('Gen_Load/kundur_ieee_no_shunt.json', default_config=True)
   n_xy = len(ss.dae.xy_name)
   print(f"Andes variables = {n_xy}")
   ss.files.no_output = True

   # fix P & Q load ANDES
   ss.PQ.config.p2p = 1.0
   ss.PQ.config.p2i = 0
   ss.PQ.config.p2z = 0

   ss.PQ.config.q2q = 1.0
   ss.PQ.config.q2i = 0
   ss.PQ.config.q2z = 0

   dae = ss.dae

   # Run PF
   ss.PFlow.config.tol = 1e-8
   ss.PFlow.run()

   #Run Small-Signal Stability analysis
   eig = ss.EIG
   eig.run()

   df_Eig = pd.DataFrame(eig.mu)
   df_Eig.to_csv("Eigenvalues_results_Andes.csv", index=False, header=False)

   df_pfactors = pd.DataFrame(eig.pfactors.T)
   df_pfactors.to_csv("pfactors_results_Andes.csv", index=False, header=False, float_format="%.10f")

    return eig.mu, eig.pfactors
```

Comparing the case of Kundur two-area system VeraGrid gets exactly the same results.

![](figures/dynamics/andes_vs_veragrid_kundur.png)

The following plot template is used to compare results.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

x1 = VeraGrid_Eig.real
y1 = VeraGrid_Eig.imag
x2= Andes_Eig.real
y2 = Andes_Eig.imag
slope = 1 / 0.05
x_z = np.linspace(-200, 0, 400)
y_z = slope * x_z
# Plot the two lines (positive and negative imaginary axis)
plt.plot(x_z, y_z, '--', color='grey', label='$\lambda$ = 5%')
plt.plot(x_z, -y_z, '--', color='grey')
plt.scatter(x2, y2, marker='o', color='orange', label='Andes')
plt.scatter(x1, y1, marker='x', color='blue', label='VeraGrid')
plt.xlabel("Re [s -1]")
plt.ylabel("Im [s -1]")
plt.title("Stability plot")
margin_x = (x1.max() - x1.min()) * 0.1
margin_y = (y1.max() - y1.min()) * 0.1
x_min = x1.min() - margin_x
x_max = x1.max() + margin_x
y_min = y1.min() - margin_y
y_max = y1.max() + margin_y
plt.xlim([x_min, x_max])
plt.ylim([y_min, y_max])
plt.axhline(0, color='black', linewidth=1)
plt.axvline(0, color='black', linewidth=1)
plt.legend(loc='upper left', ncol=2)
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

Where `VeraGrid_Eig` and `Andes_Eig` are numpy arrays with the eigenvalues results from the VeraGrid and Andes stability assessments respectively.
